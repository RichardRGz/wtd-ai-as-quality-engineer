It has to do it with the following technologies and dependencies for the automation script:
- Node.js -  LTS version.
- JavaScript as main language.
- Testcafe 3.6.0 as end-to-end testing tool.
- Dotenv 16.4.5

Also it is essential to follow the following best practices to ensure maintainability, reliability, and efficiency:
1. Use a Package Manager: Use npm or yarn to manage your dependencies and scripts. Ensure all dependencies are listed in package.json.
2. Use dotenv environment variables: To manage configurations like base URLs, credentials, and environment-specific settings.
3. Modularize the code: Break down the test scripts into smaller, reusable functions or modules. This can involve creating helper functions, page objects, and utility modules.
4. Implement the Page Object Model to separate the test scripts from the page details: This approach makes the tests more maintainable and readable.
5. Data-Driven Testing: Use data-driven tests to run the same test with different inputs. This can be achieved by parameterizing your tests and using external data sources (e.g., JSON, CSV).
6. Assertions and Error Handling: Use appropriate assertions to validate the expected outcomes. Handle errors gracefully and use try-catch blocks where necessary to capture and log meaningful errors.
7. Comments and Documentation: Document your code with meaningful comments and maintain a README file to explain the setup and execution process of your tests.
8. Consistent Naming Conventions: Follow consistent naming conventions for your test files, functions, and variables.
9. Test Reports and Logs: Generate detailed test reports and logs. TestCafe supports various reporters (e.g., JSON, HTML) which can be configured to produce comprehensive reports.
10. Modules import: Always use ES modules and avoid to import commonJS imports.

For TestCafe it required to follow the following practices:
1. Selectors: Use robust selectors (e.g., data-testid attributes) to identify elements. Avoid brittle selectors that are likely to change frequently, like CSS classes.
2. Actions and Assertions Separation: Separate actions (like clicking and typing) from assertions. This separation makes your test steps clearer and easier to debug.
3. Wait Mechanisms: Use TestCafeâ€™s built-in waiting mechanisms and avoid explicit waits where possible. Leverage Selector and await to ensure elements are available before interacting with them.
4. Always have the variables in the .env file and avoid using them in any other file in addtion that the username variable should be USER_NAME and the password should be USER_PASSWORD.
5. Never create a "process.env" variable(s) for the LoginPage.js file.
7. Don't forget to add the import of the dotenv dependecy and use them for the Login.test.js file.


Finally the POM structure for this script is should be the following:
/src
  |-- /pages
  |   |-- LoginPage.js
  |
  |-- /tests
  |   |-- Login.test.js
.env
package.json
